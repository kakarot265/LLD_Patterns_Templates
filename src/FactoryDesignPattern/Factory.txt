Factory Pattern:

Purpose: Focuses on object creation, providing a way to instantiate objects without specifying their exact class.
Use Case: When you want to create objects of a family of related classes based on a condition.

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects. It promotes loose coupling by abstracting the instantiation process, enabling flexibility and scalability in software design.

Key Features:
Encapsulation of Object Creation: The instantiation logic is hidden from the client code.
Decoupling: Reduces dependency on concrete classes.
Easy to Extend: New types of products can be added without modifying existing code.
This pattern is especially useful when the exact types of objects to create are not known until runtime.
